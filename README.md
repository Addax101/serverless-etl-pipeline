# Serverless ETL Pipeline

This repository contains the code for implementing a *serverless* **data processing pipeline** that performs *Extract-Transform-Load (ETL)* operations using AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, or *Azure Functions*. The pipeline is designed to handle large volumes of data, making it suitable for big data applications in cloud-based environments.


## Overview

The **serverless ETL pipeline** uses a combination of cloud-based services and technologies to perform data processing tasks. The pipeline consists of the following components:

- **Source Data** : The data source, which can be a file, database, or data stream.
- **ETL Functions** : Serverless functions that perform the ETL operations on the data, using a framework such as Apache Spark, Apache Flink, or AWS Glue.
- **Data Storage** : A cloud-based storage service, such as Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage, used to store the processed data.
- **Data Warehouse** : A cloud-based data warehouse, such as Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, or Azure Synapse Analytics, used to store the processed data in a structured format.

The serverless ETL pipeline is designed to be scalable, fault-tolerant, and cost-effective. It can be deployed in a variety of cloud-based environments, including AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure, depending on your specific needs.

## Architecture

The serverless ETL pipeline architecture consists of the following components:

## Components
 
- **AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, or Azure Functions** : These are the serverless compute services used to run the ETL functions.
- **Apache Spark, Apache Flink, or AWS Glue** : These are the frameworks used to perform the ETL operations on the data.
- **Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage** : These are the cloud-based storage services used to store the processed data.
- **Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, or Azure Synapse Analytics** : These are the cloud-based data warehouses used to store the processed data in a structured format.
- **API Gateway or Cloud Endpoints** : These are the API management services used to expose the serverless functions as RESTful APIs.

## Workflow

The serverless ETL pipeline workflow consists of the following steps:

- **Extract** : The data is extracted from the source data storage service.
- **Transform**: The data is transformed using the ETL functions, which are triggered by an event or scheduled to run at regular intervals.
- **Load** : The processed data is loaded into the data storage service and the data warehouse.
- **Query** : The processed data can be queried using SQL or other data analysis tools.

## Getting Started

To get started with the serverless ETL pipeline, follow these steps:

* Clone this repository to your local machine.
* Choose your cloud platform of choice (AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure) and set up the necessary credentials and services.
* Modify the configuration files in the `config` directory to specify the source data, ETL functions, data storage, and data warehouse settings.
* Deploy the ETL functions and API Gateway or Cloud Endpoints to your cloud platform using the appropriate deployment tools.
* Trigger the ETL functions manually or schedule them to run at regular intervals using the appropriate cloud-based scheduling tools.
* Monitor the ETL pipeline using the appropriate monitoring tools provided by your cloud platform.
