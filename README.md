# Serverless ETL Pipeline

This repository contains the code for implementing a serverless data processing pipeline that performs Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) operations using AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, or Azure Functions. The pipeline is designed to handle large volumes of data, making it suitable for big data applications in cloud-based environments.


## Overview

The serverless ETL pipeline uses a combination of cloud-based services and technologies to perform data processing tasks. The pipeline consists of the following components:

- **Source Data** : The data source, which can be a file, database, or data stream.
- **ETL Functions** : Serverless functions that perform the ETL operations on the data, using a framework such as Apache Spark, Apache Flink, or AWS Glue.
- **Data Storage** : A cloud-based storage service, such as Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage, used to store the processed data.
- **Data Warehouse** : A cloud-based data warehouse, such as Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, or Azure Synapse Analytics, used to store the processed data in a structured format.

The serverless ETL pipeline is designed to be scalable, fault-tolerant, and cost-effective. It can be deployed in a variety of cloud-based environments, including AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure, depending on your specific needs.
